## El Nino Prediction using Kernel Analog Forecasting (KAF) algorithm

###### the goal of this project was to make predictions of the El Nino phenomenon which allows to make predictions of the global temperature, based on the figure 5 of this article https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/huet/2022/01/13/5082/ and by using the Kernel Analog Forecasting (KAF) algorithm
